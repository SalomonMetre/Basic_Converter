A new Flutter project.

## What did I learn?

# More about Flutter
    Stateful widgets
    State changes, widgets do not
    State informs that framework about a change and the UI is then updated
    initState:
        get called when a state is built
        is called only once
    setState:
        informs the framework that the internal state has changed
        then calls build() to redraw the widget on the screen after "killing" the old widget

# Some widgets
    DropDownButton
    items:
        DropDownMenuItem<T>
    Spacer
